## ‚≠êTrain

`step 1`: Download the code and prepare the running environment

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Make sure Anaconda or Miniconda is installed.
3. Run `pip install -r requirement.txt` for environment initialization.



`step 2`: Download Datasets



`step 3`: It is convenient to perform experiment with HPFG. For example, if you want to run Mean-Teacher algorithm:

1. Modify the config file in `config/mean_teacher_unet_30k_224x224_ACDC.yaml` as you need

   ~~~yaml
   # Dataset Configuration
   datasets: "acdc" # Dataset name
   num_classes: 4 # Number of categories
   data_path: "/home/ubuntu/data/ACDC" # Dataset placement location
   save_path: "checkpoint/2023-02-26-mean_teacher-ACDC" # Code Save Location
   name: "mean_teacher-ACDC"
   ckpt: None # Pre-training weight position
   cuda: True # Whether to use GPU
   ~~~

2. Run `python 2017_03_NIPS_Mean-Teacher_ACDC.py`



If you want to run the paper project, please run the following code directly

~~~python
python main.py
~~~
